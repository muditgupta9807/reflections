When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I feel like significant work has been done and it has now to be stored in a particular site from it can be accessed easily


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


fork is cloning online to your own account and also providing the main owner of the repository to have the knowledge that who has cloned it
